\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
\noindent
  A collection of notes, quotations, and miscellaneous remarks written during my reading of Jean-Paul Sartre's \emph{Being and Nothingness}, in fulfilment of my Senior Essay at St. John's College. Sections and subsections are identical with Sartre's work, while sub-subsections (e.g. 1.3.1) are entirely my own.

% Includes content body. If the essay is very long, it might make sense to split
% the content across multiple .tex files, and include them all here, e.g.

\include{sections/part-1.tex}

\include{sections/part-2.tex}
