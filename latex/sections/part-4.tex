\chapter{Part IV: To Have, To Do, and To Be}

So what is \textsc{Part IV} about? In the introduction and the three parts, we've explored the ontology of the in-itself (i.e. the being-of-phenomena), the ontology of the for-itself, and finally the ontology of the Other -- as well as all their interleaving relationships such as the relationship of the for-itself to the in-itself (knowledge) or the relationship of the for-itself to the Other (the being-for-the-Other). With the above ontology established, we are finally able to explore the nature of the being-for-itself as an agent that \emph{acts}. It is this exploration of action that serves as the theme of Part IV. This part serves as the final third of Sartre's monograph on Phenomenological Ontology: \emph{Being and Nothingness}. Sartre introduces this part to us with the following opening-question:

\textcquote[567]{sartre}{Having, doing, and being are the fundamental categories of human reality. Every type of human behaviour can be subsumed within them. \ldots\ Is the supreme value of the human action \emph{to do} or \emph{to be}?}

\section{Chapter 1: Being and Doing: Freedom}

In this chapter, we are interested in the ontology of freedom. To begin this investigation, we first look at \emph{actions} -- which are things that our being partakes (i.e. our being \emph{acts}). This first chapter of \textsc{Part IV} is actually the much longer (and in my opinion, more important) chapter of the two chapters in this Part.

\subsection{The First Condition of Action is Freedom}

From where does an action derive its being? Sartre rejects the naively rationalist perspective that actions simply emerge from a series of contingent reasons (even erroneous reasons). Rather, he claims that no material contingency can bring about, or generate the impetus for action -- this is because any material contingency will simply be an objective description of the world in its facticity -- there will be no \emph{lack} that yields the space for action \autocite[574]{sartre}. Instead, action has to come from a \emph{nothingness} -- and that nothingness, which is the same nothingness that founds our lack and desire -- is the source of our freedom. Hence, in order to understand action, we must understand freedom -- the first condition of action.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[569]{sartre}{The point we should note at the outset is that an action is, by definition, \emph{intentional}.}
  \item \textcquote[570]{sartre}{An action necessarily implies, as its condition, some recognised \enquote{desideratum} i.e., an objective lack or even a negatity.}
  \item \textcquote[575]{sartre}{It is the act that determines its end and its motives, and the act is the expression of freedom.}
  \item \textbf{Relationship between Freedom, Unfreedom, For-itself, and In-Itself:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcquote[577]{sartre}{The innermost meaning of determinism is to establish within us an unfailing continuity of existence in itself \ldots\ Thus, the rejection of freedom can be conceived only as an attempt to apprehend oneself as a being-in-itself}
    \item \textcquote[578]{sartre}{Freedom coincides with the nothingness that lies at man's heart. It is because human-reality \emph{is not enough} that it is free, because it is constantly separated from itself, and because a nothingness that separates what it has been from what is, and from what it will be.}
    \item \textcquote[578]{sartre}{Man is free because he is not an [in-] itself but self-presence. \emph{A being that is what it is cannot be free.}}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[579]{sartre}{Human-reality is entirely abandoned, without any help of any kind, to the unbearable necessity of making itself be, right down to the last detail: In this way freedom is not \emph{a} being: it is man's being, i.e. his nothingness of being.}
  \item \textcquote[579]{sartre}{Man cannot be sometimes free and sometimes a slave: he is free in his entirety and always, or he is not.}
\end{enumerate}

What is this understanding of freedom? Freedom comes from nothingness -- not just any nothingness, but the very nothingness that lies inside our being-for-itself, like a worm in its heart. This is a \emph{very} strong claim for Sartre to make, because all of a sudden freedom is not a contingent, material property of a human -- but rather, our freedom is founded on our very being, on our ontology. Human beings are not born free, only to lose it later on. Human beings -- so far as we can \emph{be} in any case -- have the ontology of freedom. As this freedom comes from the same nothingness which serves as a foundation of our being as a being-for-itself, it means that consciousness implies freedom. Anything else would be objectivity (a being-in-itself), and hence absolute determinism.

Sartre goes on to defend and elaborate on this audacious claim in the subsequent pages, with a special focus on the idea of \enquote{passions} \autocite[581 -- 585]{sartre} encroaching or affecting our freedom. He rejects passions as an external force upon our freedom -- because any admission of a passion being beyond freedom will make our freedom deterministic to it: \textcquote[581]{sartre}{This discussion shows that only two solutions, and only two are possible: either man is entirely determined \ldots\ or, indeed, man is entirely free.}

Likewise, with this rejection of passions having any special hold over our freedom, Sartre also rejects reason as having any special hold over our freedom. Sartre makes the distinction between reasons and motives, but ultimately both are equally non-essential to our freedom. In fact, Sartre states that \textcquote[585]{sartre}{In relation to freedom, no psychological phenomenon [either passion nor reason] is favoured. All my \enquote{ways of being} manifest it equally, since they are all ways of being my own nothingness.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[591]{sartre}{In fact, reasons and motives only have the weight that my project -- i.e., the free production of the end, and of the act as having to be actualised -- confers on them. When I deliberate, the die is already cast. And if I must come to deliberate, it is simply because it is a part of my original project to take account of my motives \emph{by the means of deliberation} rather than through this or that other means of discovery.}
  \item Essentially, reasons and motives only bind our action, insofar as we ascribe their importance to them (roughly speaking).
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Once again, freedom comes from the core of our being. Sartre illustrates this quite well using an image involving a hike with friends at \autocite[595]{sartre} that deserves revisiting:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[596]{sartre}{[When giving up to fatigue] is not a contemplative apprehension of my fatigue [i.e. \enquote{thought}]; rather -- as we saw in relation to pain -- I suffer my fatigue [i.e. a relation of being].}
  \item Essentially, Sartre is telling us that we \emph{act} in a certain way, because we \emph{be} in a certain way. This line of reasoning is much clearer on an examination of \autocite[596 -- 600]{sartre}.
  \item He presents another example of this in effect, by looking at a person with an \enquote{inferiority complex} which manifests in certain ways:
  \item \textcquote[601]{sartre}{This inferiority, which I struggle against and yet recognise, was \emph{chosen} by me at the outset \ldots\ to give in to fatigue, for example, is to transcend the path still to be covered by constituting it with the meaning \enquote{the path that is too difficult to follow.}}
  \item \textcquote[602]{sartre}{Thus the inferiority complex is a free and global project of myself, as inferior next to another; it is the way in which I choose to take on my being-for-the-Other, the free solution that I find for the insurmountable scandal of the other's existence.}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
On how we are free to change our being:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[607]{sartre}{[all phenomena] which is in the end of the world which I am constantly conscious -- at least as the meaning implied by the object that I am looking at or using -- everything teaches me, myself, about my choice, i.e. about my [choice of] being.}
  \item \textcquote[607]{sartre}{Earlier we raised a question: I gave in to fatigue [in the example of the hike with friends], we said, and probably \emph{I could have done} otherwise, but at \emph{what cost}?} Or in other words, how are we free to change our choice, if our choice comes from our being?
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcquote[607]{sartre}{We are now in a position to answer it Our analysis has just shown us, in effect that this act was not \emph{gratuitous.} Of course, it could not be explained by a motive or reason conceived as the content of an earlier \enquote{state} of consciousness; but it needed \emph{to be interpreted on the basis of an original project of which it formed an integral part}.}
    \item \textcquote[607]{sartre}{In consequence it becomes clear that we cannot suppose the action could have been modified without at the same time supposing \emph{a fundamental modification in my original choice of myself.}}
    \item \textcquote[607 -- 608]{sartre}{[Hence] I can refuse to stop only though a \emph{radical conversion of my being-in-the-world}, which is to say by a sudden metamorphosis of my initial project, which is to say by a different choice of myself and my ends.}
    \item \textcquote[608]{sartre}{Moreover, this modification is always possible. The anguish which, when it is disclosed, manifests our freedom to our consciousness testifies to this constant alterability of our initial project. In anguish, we do not simply grasp the fact that the possibles we are projecting are constantly eaten into by the freedom still to come; in addition, we apprehend our choice -- which is to say ourselves -- as being \emph{unjustifiable} [i.e. we can always change our being].}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[608]{sartre}{In this way we are constantly engaged in our choice, and constantly conscious of the fact that we ourselves can suddenly reverse this choice and change course, because we project the future through our very being, and we constantly eat away at it through our own existential freedom, declaring to ourselves by the means of the future what we are, and lacking any grip on this future, which remains always \emph{possible} without ever passing into the ranks of the \emph{real} Thus we are constantly \emph{threatened} with the nihilation of our current choice, constantly threatened with choosing ourselves -- and in consequence with becoming -- other than we are. Just because our choice is absolute, it is \emph{fragile}, which is to say that, by positing our freedom through it, we posit at the same time the constant possibility of becoming something that is \enquote{on this side} and pastified, in relation to an \enquote{over on that side} that I will be.}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
For the remainder of the section, Sartre examines the various nuances and manifestations of freedom and choice being an element of our ontology. There's a particularly interesting section on bad faith and choice in \autocite[620]{sartre}, and he finally reiterates and summarises the  conclusions of this chapter in an eight-point summary at \autocite[622 -- 628]{sartre}. Having completed his elucidation on freedom, we move on to the next section.
