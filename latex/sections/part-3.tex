\chapter{Part III: Being-For-The-Other}

\section{Chapter 1: The Other's Existence}

\subsection{The Problem}

This is the introductory section \autocite[307 -- 309]{sartre} which lays out Sartre's exposition for \enquote{the problem.} Sartre admits that in all of the preceding discussions of the being-for-itself (i.e. the conscious being) and the being-in-itself (i.e. objective beings), we have left out one important and concrete mode of ontology. This mode of ontology is of the being-for-the-other -- which from my understanding so far, is the mode of being that a being-for-itself takes, when it is contemplated by another being-for-itself. The example that Sartre uses to best highlight the distinct ontological nature of a \emph{being-for-the-other} is through the emotion of \emph{shame.} Sartre uses shame as the emotion to portray this distinction because shame is unique in how it contains a component of self-recognition. It also neccesiates an \emph{Other}, for it is impossible to feel self by oneself. \textcquote[308]{sartre}{shame in its primary structure is \emph{shame before somebody.}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[308]{sartre}{Shame is \emph{recognition.} I recognise that \emph{I am} as the Other sees me.}
  \item \textcquote[308]{sartre}{Thus the Other has not only shown me what I was; he has constituted me in a new type of being, obliging me to support new qualifications.}
  \item \textcquote[309]{sartre}{But this new being that appears \emph{for} the Other does not reside \emph{in} the Other; I am responsible for it \ldots\ In this way shame is shame \emph{of myself before the Other}; these two structures are inseparable. But, by the same token, I need the Other in order to fully grasp all the structures of my being; my for-itself refers to my for-the-other.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Reef of Solipsism}

Sartre begins his exploration on the Other's existence \autocite[309 -- 322]{sartre} through an examination of the inadequacy of both \emph{realism} and \emph{idealism} to account for the existence of the Other. We are confronted with the question of \enquote{How can there be an Other?} Right now, in this pre-Other ontology of ours, there are only two kinds of beings -- beings-for-itself (the conscious being) which is the self -- and beings-in-itself, objects of our positional consciousness \autocite[309]{sartre}.

\subsubsection{Inadequacies of \emph{Realism} to justify the existence of the \emph{Other}}

We can attempt to furnish an explanation for the existence of the Other through \emph{Realism.} We observe that there is another body, that can be the subject of our intuition and consciousness. We observe the empirical phenomena associated with the other's body -- and that there are patterns that can be followed. We ultimately come to the conclusion that that the other body's behaviour can only be explained by the existence of another positional consciousness (a being-for-itself) other than our own. \textcquote[311]{sartre}{The hypothesis that best accounts for [the Other body's] ways of behaving is that of a consciousness that is analogous to mine, whose various emotions it reflects.}

However, this hypothesis -- while plausible, can never be ontologically certain -- the realist will always have other equally plausible explanations of the Other as only a body -- a mechanistic being, a perspective of pure behavioralism. \textcquote[311]{sartre}{if the Other is accessible to us only through the knowledge that we have of him, and if this knowledge is only conjectural, the Other's existence is only conjectural.}  In fact, Sartre goes on to critique the inadequacies of the realist explanation for the existence of the Other as downright a recourse to idealism. After all, if the existence of the other is conjecture and hypothesis -- it is no different from saying that it has no real foundation, but is merely ideal \autocite[312]{sartre}.

\subsubsection{Inadequacies of \emph{Idealism} to justify the existence of the \emph{Other}}

Moving on, Sartre then looks at explanations of the \emph{Other} from the perspective of \emph{Idealism} \autocite[312]{sartre}. He takes an early look at Immanuel Kant's perspective of the transcendental metaphysics -- which presents the other is an object of our experience. This makes the Other entirely a phenomenon. However, there still exists the difficulty of explaining the \emph{being} that's behind the Other. It's hard to not see the Other as \emph{noumenal} -- which would make it a thing that's entirely beyond our intuition altogether.

In this line of reasoning, Sartre proceeds to examine other \autocite[315]{sartre} potential explanations for the foundation of the Other's being, such as the Other as a \enquote{regulative concept} or \enquote{organising principle.} All are weak and inadequate:

\textcquote[315]{sartre}{Consequently, the Other is not, within my experience, a phenomenon that points toward my experience [i.e. any idealist perception] but rather one that refers in principle to phenomena that are situated outside any possible experience for me \ldots\ the concept of the Other is not purely instrumental [i.e. any organising principle]: rather than its existing \emph{for} use in the unification of phenomena, we ought on the contrary to say that various categories of phenomena seem only to exist \emph{for} it.}

\subsubsection{Where is the Other?}

It's that final line -- where \enquote{various categories of phenomena seem only to exist \emph{for} it} -- that hints towards the ultimate ontological foundation of the Other:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[316]{sartre}{That \emph{Other}, whose relation to myself cannot be apprehended, and who is never given, is gradually constituted by us as a concrete object:
  \marginnote{Do we once again see the familiar them of seperation, or negation, as the root behind a being's ontology?}
  he is not the instrument of which I make use to predict an event within my experience; rather, it is the events in my experience that used to constitute the Other as Other, i.e. as a system of representations that is beyond reach as concrete and knowable object.}
  \item From this fundamentally separate foundation of the Other's being, we are able to experience co-incident phenomenae which are valid and possible events in our experience, i.e. \textcquote[316]{sartre}{the Other's feelings, the Other's ideas, the other's acts of will, the Other's character.}
  \item \textcquote[316]{sartre}{That is because the Other is not, in point of fact, the only one whom I see \textbf{but the one \emph{who sees me.}} I aim at the Other insofar as he is a connected system of experiences out of reach, within which I figure as one object among others.}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textcquote[316]{sartre}{The Other, on contrary, is presented as in some sense the \emph{radical negation of my experience,} \textbf{since he is the one for whom I am not a subject but an object.}}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[319]{sartre}{At the origin of the problem of the Other's existence there is a fundamental mental presuppposition: that the Other is indeed the \emph{other}, which is to say that [it] \emph{is not} me; here, therefore, we are apprehending \textbf{a negation as a constitutive struce of Other-being.}}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Sartre ends this section \autocite[316 -- 321]{sartre} with further looks at how both Kantian idealism and realism are insufficient to give account for the Other, but the specifics are not that important. He than proceeds to examine the perspective of the other from the perspective of Husserl, Hegel, and Heidegger in the following section.

\subsection{Husserl, Hegel, Heidegger}

In this section, Sartre continues with the exploration of the other from the perspective of Husserl, Hegel, and then Heidegger-- and discusses both their strengths, as well as their inadequacies.

\subsubsection*{Husserl's Conception of the Other}

Husserl's phenomenology makes the other a neccessary part of the world's existence, where \textcquote[322]{sartre}{The Other is present within it not only as this concrete and empirical appearance but as a permanent condition of its unity and its richness.} However, this account for the existence of the Other fails to explain how is it possible for the self to know the Other. \textcquote[323]{sartre}{It is evident too that the meaning of \enquote{the Other} cannot come from experience, or from an argument from analogy made on the occasion of experience: rather, and quite to the contrary, it is in light of the concept of the \emph{Other} that experience is interpreted.} If there is a realm of experiences that are rendered objective by the other, we may always have access to the experiences themselves. But how can we have access to the other behind these experiences. Here, Sartre critiques the Husserl explanation as sharing the same flaws of Kant's idealism-- namely that the Other it speaks about has a transcendental, unreachable side. \textcquote[325]{sartre}{\ldots\ Husserl was able to establish between my being and the Other's is that of \emph{knowledge}; [however] he cannot therefore, any ore than Kant could, escape Solipsism.}

\subsubsection*{Hegel's Conception of the Other}

The Hegelian conception of the Other \autocite[325 -- 328]{sartre} is a richer, more elaborate development, where the Other is seem as a self-recognition of consciousness. Hegel's Lord and Bondsman relationship is used to explain aspects of both the self-recognition, as well as of the difference between the self and other.

However, ultimately Hegel's conception also proved to be lacking, as Sartre explains starting from \autocite[329]{sartre}. I'm not sure if I follow his reasoning in the entirety, but the essense seems to be how the Lord-and-Bondsman relationship requires the consciousness to hold itself in objectivity. This is ontologically impossible, since the for-itself cannot conceive of itself as an in-itself \autocite[334]{sartre}.

\subsubsection*{Heidegger's Conception of the Other}

What is Heidegger's conception of the Other? It is perhaps the most complete one yet. I think the thing that is the most persuasive to me, is the idea that the relationship between the self and the other cannot be mediated in any case as relationships of knowledge and being, or being and knowledge -- but it is only possible on the condition of being and being.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[336]{sartre}{What have we gained from this lengthy critique? Simply this: if it must be possible to refute solipsism, my relation to the Other is, first and fundamentally, a relation of being to being, and not of knowledge to knowledge.}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \enquote{Indeed, we have seen the failure of Husserl, who, on this particular front, measures being by knowledge, and the failure of Hegel, who identifies knowledge and being.}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[336]{sartre}{It seems that Heidegger, in \emph{Being and Time}, has profited from the meditations of his precursors and has profoundly absorbed this twofold necessity:}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \enquote{The relation of \enquote{human-realities} must be a relation of being;}
    \item \enquote{this relation must make \enquote{human-realities} depend on each other in their essential being.}
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[338]{sartre}{Our [the self and the Other] relation is not a \emph{frontal} opposition; rather, it is an interdependence \emph{alongside:} insofar as I make it the case that a world exists as a structure of equipment, of which I make use for the purpose of my human-reality, I come to be determined in my being by a being who makes it the case that the same world exists as a structure of equipment for the purpose of his reality.}
  \item \textcquote[338]{sartre}{What I make myself to be is, therefore, a mode of being. And this truth means that I am responsible for my being for the \emph{Other} insofar as I actualise it freely, in authenticity or inauthenticity.}
  \marginnote{This section of Sartre's discussion on Heidegger's conception of the Other touches upon the themes of authenticity, in-authenticity, individuality, and the pursuit of such. I find this section to be of immense personal interest to me, especially the idea of acting ever more authentically.}
  \item \textcquote[339]{sartre}{In particular, when I am in the mode of inauthenticity -- of the \enquote{they} -- the world sends back to me something like an impersonal reflection of my inauthentic possibilities in the guise of implements and structures of equipment that belongs to \enquote{everyone,} and which belongs to me insofar as I am \enquote{everyone:} ready-made clothes, public transport, parks, gardens, public spaces, shelters that are built so that \emph{anyone} can shelter there, etc. In this way I become acquainted with myself as \emph{anyone} by the referential structure of equipment, which refers to me as a \enquote{\emph{Worumwillen},}\footnote{Heidegger's translators render the phrase \emph{Worumwillen} as \enquote{for-the-sake-of-which.}}  but as a complete interchangeability in terms of the relation}
  \marginnote{What is the specific nature of this common inauthenticity called the \enquote{they}, and how do we manifest it in our everyday lives or as a member of an impersonal society?}
  \item \textcquote[339]{sartre}{\textbf{Authenticity and individuality have to be won:} I will be my own authenticity \emph{only if,} under the influence of the call of conscience (\emph{Ruf des Gewissens}) I throw myself toward death, as toward my ownmost possibility, with resolute-decision (\emph{Entschlossenheit}). At that moment I am disclosed to myself in authenticity, and I raise others, too, along with me, in the direction of authenticity.}
  \marginnote{I know that Sartre is quoting Heidegger here, but what does he mean by the call of conscience, and by the throwing towards death?}
\end{enumerate}

Sartre's presentation turns towards a critique starting at \autocite[340]{sartre}. For Heidegger to claim that the foundation of the Other's existence is in ourselves through the process of our own \emph{being-with} (e.g. the analogy of the team), it is still absolutely neccesary for us to explain the nature of the being-with, which he does not do satisfactorily.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcquote[341]{sartre}{What would need to be shown, in fact, is that \enquote{being-with-Pierre} or \enquote{being-with-Anny} is a constitutive structure of my concrete-being. But that is impossible, from the standpoint that Heidegger has taken up.}
  \item \textcquote[342]{sartre}{My \emph{being-with}, apprehended on the basis of \enquote{my} being, can be regarded only as a pure demand, founded in my being, and which does not constitute the least proof of the Other's existence, the least bridge between me and the other.}
  \item \textcquote[344]{sartre}{The nature of the Other's existence is that of a contingent and a irreduible fact. We \emph{encounter} the other; we do not constitute him.}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
After examining the prior three accounts for the Other, as well as sharing their merits as well as flaws, Sartre begins his exploration of the Other from his own account.
